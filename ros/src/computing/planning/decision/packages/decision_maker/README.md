# Decision Maker

### Overview
Autoware package that visualize internal state and publish some commands.

### Parameters from runtime manager
Parameter|Type|Description
--|---|--
enable_display_marker|Bool|(default: *false*)<br>not used
auto_mission_reload|Bool|(default: *false*)<br>If this is set true, decision maker automatically reloads mission as new mission after previous mission is completed.
use_management_system|Bool|(default: *false*)<br>This must be true in order to incoorporate with [Autoware Management System](https://github.com/CPFL/AMS)
disuse_vector_map|Bool|(default: *false*)<br> If set *true*, decision_maker will exit "MapInitState" even if vector map is not successfully loaded.
num_of_steer_behind|Int|(default: *20*)<br> lookup distance along waypoints to determine steering state(straight, turning right, or turning left)
change_threshold_dist|Double|(default: *1*)<br> This is relevent only if *use_management_system* is *true*.<br> If the distance from vehicle to closest waypoint in the new mission is further than *change_threshold_dist* [m], mission change fails.
change_threshold_angle|Double|(default:*15*)<br>This is relevent only if *use_management_system* is *true*.<br> If the angle from vehicle to closest waypoint in the new mission is further than this *change_threshold_dist* [deg], mission change fails.
time_to_avoidance|Double|(default: *3*)<br> If the vehicle is stuck for *time_to_avoidance* seconds (e.g. due to obstacles), the state transits to from "Go" to "Avoidance".
goal_threshold_dist|Double|(default: *3*)<br> Threshold used to check if vehicle has reached to the goal (i.e. end of waypoints). The vehicle must be less than *goal_threshold_dist* [m] to the goal.
goal_threshold_vel|Double|(default: *0.1*)<br> Threshold used to check if vehicle has reached to the goal (i.e. end of waypoints). The vehicle must be less than *goal_threshold_vel* [m/s] to be treated as goal arrival.

### Requirements of each state or behavior

- ##### Initialize

State name|Required topic|Description
--|---|--
Init|-|The parent state of the following states.
SensorInit|/filtered_points|
MapInit||
LocalizationInit|/current_pose|
PlanningInit|/closest_waypoint|
VehicleInit|-|


- ##### Ready to driving
  1. Launch Autoware and localization on real vehicle or wf_simulator
  2. Launch `decision_maker` and lane_planner, astar_planner, waypoint_follower
  3. When `VehicleReady` and `WaitOrder` state, launch `waypoint_loader`
  4. On `DriveReady` state, push `Engage` button on DecisionMakerPannel
  5. When the vehicle reaches the end of waypoint and stops, state Mission state transits to `WaitOrder` via the `MissionComplete`
  6. You can repeat from 3. with other waypoint

- ##### Move backward

- ##### Lane change
  1. Start Normal driving with waypoint files necessary for lane change
  2. On `CheckLeft` or `RightLane` state, push `Execute LaneChange` button on DecisionMakerPannel
  3. The vehicle start lane change

- ##### Stop at stop line

- ##### Driving mission change
  1. Prepare waypoint files to change, and start Normal driving
  2. On `Driving` state, push `Request mission change` button on DecisionMakerPannel
  3. When the state becomes `DrivingMissionChange`, please load another waypoint for change
  4. If it is possible to change the waypoint will switch, otherwise it will not be changed
